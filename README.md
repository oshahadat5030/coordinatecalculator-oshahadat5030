# GitHub-CoordinateCalculator
*Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University*

### Instructions:

Use GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and Jupyter Notebooks to edit the starter *Python Interactive Notebook* file called <code>CoordinateCalculator.ipynb</code> so that user-supplied geographic coordinates in degrees-minutes-second (DDMMSS) format are converted to decimal degrees (DD).  Make sure that your notebook includes the following elements, features, and/or capabilities:

1. Requests and accepts user-supplied coordinates in DDMMSS format (e.g., 391120 or 39 11 20) using the Python <code>input()</code> function.
2. Performs all necessary mathematical operations to convert the input coordinate into DD as a floating point number.
3. Prints the resulting DD coordinate at along with a friendly message.  For example, "Your final result is:  39.19 degrees".
4. Incorporates several text blocks in Markdown format explaining what your Python code blocks accomplish..

## Challenge:

See if you can find and apply the built-in Python function that will automatically round your final answer to two decimal places.

## Submission:

Commit your code changes to your assignment repository on GitHub.
